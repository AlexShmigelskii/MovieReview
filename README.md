## Introduction

The MovieReview project is a web application that allows users to enter a movie review and get a sentiment analysis of that review. The application is built using Python, Django, and machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and NLTK.

The sentiment analysis model was trained using a combination of NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms. The model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set. The dataset used for training the model is the IMDb movie review dataset, which consists of reviews of various movies.
